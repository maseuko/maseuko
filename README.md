### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


#### Something about myself :smiley:
I'm a beginning frontend/backend developer that's looking for his first job, right now I'd prefer to work as a backend developer because I found it more interesting than frontend, but still both are extremly fun! What i like the most of backend is the feeling that you'r creating something alive, something that calculates and thinks for you, and it feels amazing, on the other hand there is a frontend, when everything combines into one solid piece of art, everything appears as you wish, behave like you wanted them to behave! As you can see there is something of geek in me :sunglasses:, but those are not the only things I do, another side hobbies are for instance mastering an english skills, because of people I met abroad, I just don't want to sound retarded :confused:, even though sometimes it's like that I ain't gonna give up, because that's exactly what it means to develop, I know that I'm not perfect and probably never gonna be but I'm going for it no matter what. I'd describe my english skills in something between B2+ and C1, as my friends said: "It's not that bad". Some of my another hobbies are watching movies, tv series and listening to music :movie_camera: :musical_note:

#### What I'm the most proud of?
