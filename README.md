## Hi there 👋


### Something about myself :smiley:
I'm a beginning frontend/backend developer that's looking for his first job, right now I'd prefer to work as a backend developer because I found it more interesting than frontend, but still both are extremly fun! What i like the most of backend is the feeling that you'r creating something alive, something that calculates and thinks for you, and it feels amazing, on the other hand there is a frontend, when everything combines into one solid piece of art, everything appears as you wish, behave like you wanted them to behave! As you can see there is something of geek in me :sunglasses:, but those are not the only things I do, another side hobbies are for instance mastering an english skills, because of people I met abroad, I just don't want to sound retarded :confused:, even though sometimes it's like that I ain't gonna give up, because that's exactly what it means to develop, I know that I'm not perfect and probably never gonna be but I'm going for it no matter what. I'd describe my english skills in something between B2+ and C1, as my friends said: "It's not that bad". Some of my another hobbies are watching movies, tv series and listening to music :movie_camera: :musical_note:. And for the last but not least I LOVE MEMES!

### What's my tech stack? :sunny:

- Java
- Spring
- Nodejs
- Vue
- React
- Partly Angular(I haven't written in it a lot)
- MySql
- Rest API
- MongoDB
- HTML
- Css
- SASS/SCSS

### What I'm the most proud of?
<p align="center"> :dizzy::star2::star2: <a href="https://sciborowka.pl">Ściborówka</a> :star2::star2::dizzy:</p>

That project combined most of my knowledge, I builded it from scratch in vue, with a spring application at backend, It's also hosted on my own VPS on Linux Ubuntu somewhere in a web, I generated my own SSL, configured the Nginx on my own, redirect correctly DNS to point at what i want it to point and puff, it display on the screen from any device i want to. My favorite sentence is "If you don't know how to do it, look for an answears, somone faced that issue for sure so there's gotta be an answear!". So there is no excuses in building anything! You just gotta be stubborn and focused on your goal :soccer:

You can look at my solutions I faced building that page in my repos :blush:

### Last words 
I know that I probably made a lot of mistakes in a text above, but first of all I'm not a native english speaker and I'm still learning that on my own, and I can promise it already that I'm gonna be better! I can write down here that I'm the best and try to convince you that I really am, but I'm gonna be honest with you, I'm not but I can promise that I'll aim as high as it's possible to reach your expectations! So I'm looking forward to meet you f2f :sweat_smile:

And as a side note, those projects are not gonna be last, I'm already working on another ones! And for sure I'm gonna show them off as soon as they'll be done! :dizzy:
